# 🏥 Healthcare Analysis Report - Power BI Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an interactive **Healthcare Analysis Dashboard** built in **Power BI** to help analyze screening eligibility and participation among healthcare members. The dashboard provides key insights into **member eligibility, screening participation, and demographic distributions** using dynamic slicers and visualizations.  

## 🚀 Features  
### 🔹 **Key Metrics (KPIs)**  
- **Total Members Eligible for Screening** – Tracks the number of members who qualify for screenings.  
- **Total Members Who Received Screening** – Measures the number of members who completed their screenings.  
- **Total Members Who Didn’t Receive Screening** – Identifies gaps in screening participation.  

### 🔹 **Dashboards & Charts**  
- 📊 **Members Eligible for Screening by Ethnicity** – Analyzes eligibility distribution across different ethnic groups.  
- 📈 **Members Eligible for Screening by Race** – Examines screening eligibility based on race demographics.  
- 🌍 **Members Eligible for Screening by Region** – Categorizes screening eligibility based on geographical distribution (EMEA, USCA, APAC, Other).  
- 🗣 **Members Eligible for Screening by Preferred Language** – Shows screening eligibility based on members’ primary spoken language.  

### 🔄 **Interactive Slicers**  
- **Select Metric** (Members Eligible for Screening, Members Received Screening, Members Didn’t Receive Screening)  
- **Region** (USCA, EMEA, APAC, Other)  
- **Original Member Ethnicity**  
- **Original Race**  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
### 📌 **Background**  
A healthcare organization aims to **improve preventive care efforts** by analyzing **member eligibility and participation in screenings**. Understanding **screening trends, demographic disparities, and regional distributions** is critical for enhancing **public health strategies** and **reducing health disparities**.  

### 📌 **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to develop a **Power BI dashboard** that visually represents **screening eligibility and participation trends**, allowing healthcare professionals to:  
- **Identify populations with low screening participation** for targeted outreach.  
- **Assess screening eligibility across ethnic, racial, and regional demographics** to ensure equitable healthcare access.  
- **Analyze trends in screening participation** for informed policy-making and healthcare resource allocation.  

## ⚡ **Key Challenges**  
- **Data Integration** – Consolidating member screening data while maintaining consistency.  
- **Data Privacy** – Ensuring compliance with **HIPAA** and other healthcare regulations.  
- **Visualization & Usability** – Creating clear, insightful, and interactive dashboards for stakeholders.  
- **Regional Categorization** – Mapping **languages to regions** (EMEA, USCA, APAC, Other) for meaningful geographic analysis.  

## 🛠️ Requirements  
- **Power BI Desktop (Latest Version)** for building and visualizing reports.  
- **Healthcare Screening Data** (Excel, CSV, or Database connection).  
- **DAX & Power Query Knowledge** for advanced calculations and data transformations.  

## 📌 Usage  
1. **Load the dataset** into Power BI.  
2. **Refresh the data** to ensure the latest screening statistics are included.  
3. **Use the slicers** to filter data by **metric, region, ethnicity, or race**.  
4. **Analyze screening trends** and identify gaps in healthcare participation.
